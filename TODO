URGENT TODOS:
1) ByteBuffer in WorldPacket should contain header data as well, 
this is better idea than dynamically allocating char* whenever
i want to send a packet. Too much memcpy-ing is going on

2) Fix log out on both server and client. This worked in [90]
but seems like boost & thread branches broke it.
We need to do proper cleanup

3) Propertly clean up SPELL_BOLT on client side when its erased from server

4) Send unix time stamp in packet header and take it into consideration when
spawning SPELL_BOLTs

5) Use chrono instead of posix time to calculate Update diffs (when update took
longer than 50ms)

URGENT TODOS:
1) ByteBuffer in WorldPacket should contain header data as well, 
this is better idea than dynamically allocating char* whenever
i want to send a packet. Too much memcpy-ing is going on

2) Fix log out on both server and client. This worked in [90]
but seems like boost & thread branches broke it.
We need to do proper cleanup

Code:
- Command system for creating accounts, modifying password accounts, more...
- Handle case where we haven't variadic template and vsnprintf_s available
- GUI System for Chat (SFGUI ?)
- Some data may/should be Uint8 instead of Uint16
- Cleanup Includes/forward declares...
- Give tilesets IDs instead of std::strings
- world_edit
- site to register accounts (RenaissanceinCroatia working on it)
- Melee attack
- Finish animations
- Move spells to DB
- Items
- Combat stats (health, mana..)
- ObjID => GUID

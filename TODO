URGENT TODOS:
Branch asio TODO:
Consider using boost::pool on both server and client to allocate memory
for WorldPackets ONLY!!

2) Fix log out on both server and client. This worked in [90]
but seems like boost & thread branches broke it.
We need to do proper cleanup

3) Propertly clean up SPELL_BOLT on client side when its erased from server

4) Send unix time stamp in packet header and take it into consideration when
spawning SPELL_BOLTs

5) [strike]Shit I forgot...[/strike]
I remembered!
Consider using either raw pointers or home brew non reference counting pointers (with owner)
to improve server performance

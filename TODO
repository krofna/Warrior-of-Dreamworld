URGENT TODOS:
1) ByteBuffer in WorldPacket should contain header data as well, 
this is better idea than dynamically allocating char* whenever
i want to send a packet. Too much memcpy-ing is going on

2) There is a small chance (about 0.1% when last tested) that client
will crash if main thread calls WorldSession::Send while network thread
is writing data to a socket

Code:
- Some data may/should be Uint8 instead of Uint16
- Cleanup Includes/forward declares...
- Give tilesets IDs instead of std::strings
- world_edit
- site to register accounts (RenaissanceinCroatia working on it)
- Investigate server crashes (Krofna working on it)
- Melee attack
- Finish animations
- Move spells to DB
- Items
- Combat stats (health, mana..)
- ObjID => GUID
